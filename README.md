# CHUCKNORRIS.IO

JSON API for random [Chuck Norris jokes](https://api.chucknorris.io).

[chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io) is a free JSON API for hand curated Chuck Norris facts.

Chuck Norris facts are satirical factoids about martial artist and actor Chuck Norris that have become an Internet
phenomenon and as a result have become widespread in popular culture. The 'facts' are normally absurd hyperbolic claims
about Norris' toughness, attitude, virility, sophistication, and masculinity.

Chuck Norris facts have spread around the world, leading not only to translated versions, but also spawning localized
versions mentioning country-specific advertisements and other Internet phenomena. Allusions are also sometimes made to
his use of roundhouse kicks to perform seemingly any task, his large amount of body hair with specific regard to his
beard, and his role in the action television series Walker, Texas Ranger.

## Local development

To start the stack using docker you need to set a couple of environment variables which are defined in an env file in the root directory of the project. All required variable identifiers are shipped in the [.env.dist](./.end.dist) file which you can use as an example.

```sh
$ docker-compose up     # Will run as a long running process
$ docker-compose up -d  # Will run in background
```

### Accessing the applications

By default only two ports of the complete stack are exposed to your localhost, those are:
  - `80`
  - `443`

### Viewing the stack logs

As long as your are inside the project's root directory you can run one of the following to see the container logs:

```sh
$ docker-compose logs     # Equivalent to tail -f and show all containers
$ docker-compose logs web # Will only show logs for the nginx container
$ docker-compose logs api # Will only show logs for the api container
```
